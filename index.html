    <h4 class="Sailing">Sailing:</h4>
    <p class="Sailing">When I was less than six years old, my brother used to sail. Many times I would go to the ckub that he went to to watch him and be with him. Once I got old enough to sail myself, I started immediately. I started when I was seven years old, and continued sailing until I was twelve. When I was twelve I had gotten too big for the boat that I had been sailing, so for a month or two I stopped, until I joined another program with a larger boat, that I am doing still now. Some notable things I accomplished while sailing is winning a few regattas (competitions for sailing) and even competing once when I was nine at the U.S youth championships.</p>

     <article class="Div-skiing">
    <h4 class="Skiing">Skiing:</h4>
    <p class="Skiing">Every winter except for the past three years, I went to Utah for a week to ski and see some extended family who live there. it had always been something I enjoyed extremely, because the feeling of being alone on top of a mountain going high speed is like nothing I had never experienced anywhere else. Unfortunately between Covid and other reasons I have not been able to ski recently and I am extremely sad about that.</p>

    <article class="Div-climbing">
      <h4 class="climbing">Climbing:</h4>
    <p class="climbing">I rarely go climbing, but when I do, I enjoy it very much. I sometimes go to a climbing gym which is about an hour drive from my house that has several different walls, but because of Covid, I havent gone recently. Back when I went, I considered myself decent at it, as I was able to do basically all of the vertical walls, and even some of the ones past ninety-degrees, but I was unable to do any of the expert walls.

    <article class="Div-video">
    <h4 class="videogames">Playing VideoGames:</h4>
    <p class="videogames">Every since my brother started playing video games when I was little, I became enamored with them. The moment my mom let me get a console, I got one, and begun to play with my friends almost every day. When I turned thirteen, I got a gaming laptop, and begun to start gaming competitevely, and I actually got quite good at it. Recently there haven't been any good games, but my all time favorites have to be Titanfall 2 and Cod: Modern Warfare 2019.
